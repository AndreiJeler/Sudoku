Sudoku application using Angular and the API from [SuGOku](https://github.com/bertoort/sugoku).

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

[Hosted single player Angular app](https://test-sudoku-byod54rc2q-uc.a.run.app/)

## Start the angular application

Run `npx nx run sudoku:serve` to start the Angular app in development mode.

## Start the server

Run `npx nx run sudoku-server:serve ` to start the .Net server in development mode.

## Details:
- Angular was used for the client app and .NET for the multiplayer (right now is just creating rooms and share them to other users) server
- Angular 17 with Standalone Components, inside a NX monorepo
- .NET 8, which implements a Hub for communication using sockets (not fully functional)
- State management using NgRx, the calls to SuGOku being made from the state, that contains the current board and other information
- Generate, validate and solve a sudoku board are done by the external API [SuGOku](https://github.com/bertoort/sugoku)
- A simple modal as a loader for HTTP requests to SuGOku
- Base Component class that is handling subscriptions on destroy
- Base API service for HTTP requests (both for co-op server and SuGOku)
- User can create its own board, if a board is not generated using a difficulty button
- If a cell is selected, the corresponding row and column are also highlighted, to be easier to see the possibilities 

## Notes
- The create a room button is just creating a board on the server that can be accesed by other players, but the co-op is not fully implemented
- Custom made icon
