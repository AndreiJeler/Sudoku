## Start the angular application

Run `npx nx run sudoku:serve` to start the Angular app in development mode.

## Start the server

Run `npx nx run sudoku-server:serve ` to start the .Net server in development mode.

## Details:
- Angular was used for the client app and .NET for the multiplayer (right now is just creating rooms and share them to other users) server
- Angular 17 with Standalone Components, inside a NX monorepo
- State management using NgRx
- Generate, validate and solve a sudoku board are done by the external API [SuGOku](https://github.com/bertoort/sugoku)
- User can create its own board, if a board is not generated using a difficulty button

## Notes
- The create a room button is just creating a board on the server that can be accesed by other players, but the co-op is not fully implemented
